# development_task
Post-interview task for Pirate Labs using Python and Django. 

Most of my work can be found in the pirate_labs folder in the settings.py and urls.py files, as well as in the user folder in views.py
urls.py, register.html, login.html, and welcome.html. At the bottom of the settings.py file I included links to sources I used to 
familiarize myself with Django.
